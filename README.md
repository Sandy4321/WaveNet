# WaveNet
A Wavelet Neural Network implementation, code was derived from a paper called "Wavelet neural networks: A practical guide" by A. K. Alexandridis and A. D. Zapranis

Wavelets have been shown to improve ANN results when used as a pre-processing step on data, they were then taken and used as a neuron activation function for WNNs. They also fit well with the neurological metaphor of neural networks, as there is evidence that a process similar to wavelet transforms occurs in the visual cortex of the brain.
